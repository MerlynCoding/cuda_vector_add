# concurrent programming

### 1. **What is a Thread?**
   - A **thread** is like a tiny task that a computer does. Imagine it like a worker doing a small job. You can have many workers (threads) doing different jobs at the same time. This helps the program run faster.
   - **Multi-threading** means running several tasks at once, which is useful for modern computers with **multiple processors (cores)**.

### 2. **What Does the CPU Do?**
   - Modern computers have multiple **cores** in the CPU (like 4 to 8 cores). Each core can run its own thread, so the computer can do many things at once.
   - The **scheduler** is a part of the operating system that decides which thread gets to run on which core. It makes sure that the computer is always doing something and not just waiting.

### 3. **Switching Threads:**
   - Sometimes, the computer has to **switch between threads**. When one thread is waiting for something (like data from memory), the scheduler moves to another thread.
   - But **switching threads** is not free. It takes time, and if the computer switches threads too much, it can slow things down.

### 4. **Memory Caching:**
   - Computers have different types of memory:
     - **Registers** (very fast memory right on the CPU).
     - **Cache** (slightly slower, but still fast, and used to store data that is used often).
     - **RAM** (slower than cache but can hold more data).
   - **Cache** helps speed things up because it stores frequently used data closer to the CPU. This means the computer doesn’t have to go all the way to RAM every time it needs something.
   - **L1, L2, and L3** are different levels of cache. The higher the number, the larger and slower the cache is.

### 5. **Why Switching Between Threads is Slow:**
   - **Thread switching** happens when the computer has to pause one thread and start another. This takes some time, and too much switching can hurt performance.
   - The goal is to **switch threads less** and let them run as much as possible before switching.

### 6. **Why is Parallel Processing Important?**
   - **Parallel processing** means breaking a big job into smaller tasks and running them at the same time on different cores. This makes things faster, especially for tasks like **artificial intelligence** or **video processing** that need a lot of computing power.
   - But managing the threads and memory is important. If you don’t manage them properly, things can get messy and slow.

### In Short:
- **Threads** are small tasks the computer runs. Multiple threads let a computer do many things at once.
- The **scheduler** makes sure threads run on the right core, but switching threads too much can slow things down.
- **Memory caches** (like L1, L2) help speed up tasks by storing frequently used data close to the CPU.
- **Parallel processing** helps with big tasks by breaking them into smaller tasks that can run at the same time.

### Why You Care:
If you write programs that need to do many things at once, understanding how to manage threads and memory properly will make your program run faster and more efficiently.
