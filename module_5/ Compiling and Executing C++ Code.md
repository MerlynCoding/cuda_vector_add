1. **Code Overview**:  
   - **Main Function**: Initializes `x` and `y` arrays, performs addition, verifies the results, and deallocates memory.
   - **Add Function**: Adds elements of two arrays sequentially. This function operates on all elements in a single thread.

2. **Compilation**:  
   Use `gcc` or `g++` to compile:
   ```bash
   g++ example_code.cpp -o example_code.exe
   ```
3. **Execution**:  
   Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./example_code.exe
   ```

### **2. Compiling and Executing CUDA Runtime API Code**

1. **Key Differences**:  
   - The `global` keyword indicates that the function is a GPU kernel.
   - Memory allocation and copying between host and GPU are required.
   - Example uses minimal threads (one block, one thread), which is inefficient but illustrative.

2. **Steps in Code**:  
   - Allocate memory for host and device.
   - Copy data from host to device.
   - Execute the kernel using triple angle brackets `<<< >>>`.
   - Copy the results back to the host.
   - Free memory.

3. **Compilation**:  
   Use `nvcc` for CUDA compilation:
   ```bash
   nvcc runtime_example.cu -o runtime_example.exe
   ```

4. **Execution**:  
   Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./runtime_example.exe
   ```

### **3. Compiling and Executing CUDA Driver API Code**

1. **Key Features**:
   - Requires explicit management of devices, contexts, and memory.
   - More complex than the Runtime API but offers greater control.

2. **Steps in Code**:  
   - **Initialization**:
     - Select a CUDA device and create a context.
     - Load the CUDA module (`.fatbin` file) and retrieve the kernel function.
   - **Memory Allocation**:
     - Allocate host and device memory (`CUdeviceptr`).
   - **Kernel Launch**:
     - Launch the kernel by passing the function pointer, grid/block dimensions, and memory pointers.
   - **Memory Deallocation**:
     - Free device and host memory.

3. **Compilation**:  
   - Generate `.fatbin` file for the kernel:
     ```bash
     nvcc -o kernel.fatbin -fatbin kernel.cu
     ```
   - Compile the main code and link it with the CUDA driver:
     ```bash
     g++ driver_example.cpp -o driver_example.exe -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 -lcuda
     ```

4. **Execution**:  
   Ensure the `.fatbin` file is in the same directory as the executable:
   ```bash
   ./driver_example.exe
   ```

### **Comparison of Runtime and Driver APIs**

| **Feature**                | **Runtime API**                                    | **Driver API**                            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**            | Easier (abstracts low-level operations)           | More complex, requires explicit management |
| **Memory Management**      | Automatic for kernel access                       | Manual memory allocation and deallocation |
| **Kernel Launch**          | Simple (`<<< >>>`)                                | Requires function pointers and configuration |
| **Compilation Workflow**   | Single step with `nvcc`                          | Two steps: `.fatbin` generation and executable compilation |
| **Flexibility**            | Limited control                                  | High control over GPU behavior           |

### **Tips for Efficient CUDA Code**

1. **Threading**:
   - Use at least 32 threads per block, always in multiples of 32 for efficiency.
   - For multi-dimensional problems (e.g., images), use grids and blocks to map the problem's dimensions.

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Avoid frequent memory transfers between host and GPU.
   - Use shared memory or constant memory for better performance.

3. **Compilation Options**:
   - Use `-arch` or `-gencode` to target specific GPU architectures.
   - For debugging, add `-G` to enable debug information.

4. **Kernel Optimization**:
   - Minimize thread divergence by ensuring threads in a warp execute similar instructions.
   - Use appropriate memory access patterns to maximize memory bandwidth.
